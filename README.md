# StateMachine
Build the app using Android Studio
This App uses a Repository simulating a StateMachine that will output a random state from "a" to "d". The view will show what states are being evaluated, along with validation if it is possible to evaluate those states at the moment. After a validation, all the states that have been evaluated are cleared.
